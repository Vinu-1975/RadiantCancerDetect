## Models Used
The following machine learning models were utilized in this project for breast cancer detection:

- XGBoost
- K Nearest Neighbour Classification
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Convolutional Neural Network
- Na√Øve Bayes
- Hierarchical Clustering

*Please note that only a subset of these models is available in the webpage interface for interactive testing:* **[KNN, RandomForest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost]**
